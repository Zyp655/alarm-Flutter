An example application built with dart_frog

## Environment Setup

This backend uses environment variables for database configuration to keep sensitive credentials secure.

### Initial Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and update with your actual database credentials:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=alarmm_db
   DB_USERNAME=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

3. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to version control.

### Running the Backend

```bash
dart_frog dev
```

The application will automatically load the environment variables from `.env` on startup.

### Important Notes

- **Never commit `.env`** to version control
- Always keep `.env.example` updated with the structure (but not the actual values)
- Each developer needs to create their own `.env` file with their local credentials
